Add some kind of `compile()` function to the components
Allow compiling to jar, or running in place
  If run in place, allow debug mode where things are slow and the channels flash when used
Allow generics
  Consider IntOrEventualClass - maybe add named generics (how coordinate?)
Allow copy blocks
Show block/terminal names
Fix connection weirdness
