Button you can push from the wiring gui, in visible run mode
  Other wiring-visible components, like displays or toggle switches
Add some kind of `compile()` function to the components
Allow compiling to jar, or running in place
  If run in place, allow debug mode where things are slow and the channels flash when used
Allow generics
  Consider IntOrEventualClass - maybe add named generics (how coordinate?)
Allow copy blocks
Show block/terminal names
Fix connection weirdness
When connecting terminal, highlight acceptable targets
Make block list dynamic
Blocks that accept `T...` connections?  Like, when you're dragging a connection, suddenly it has an extra terminal?  (What about dragging from?  Perhaps when you hold shift it shows up?)
Constructor parameter terminals?
Sort out the Block vs ProcessBlock spatial dilemma!
Need type tooltips, or while-dragging info
Ideas from Blender:
  Collapse nodes?
  In-line params?
Blocks:
  constants
  math
    plain
    eval
  splitter
